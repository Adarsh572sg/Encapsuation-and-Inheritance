## Introduction

Encapsulation and inheritance are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). This repository aims to provide a clear understanding of these concepts through practical examples and explanations.

## Encapsulation

### Definition

Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting access to some of an object's components and protecting the object's internal state from unauthorized modification. It is achieved by using private and protected access modifiers.

### Examples

In this section, we provide Jupyter Notebook examples that demonstrate how to implement encapsulation in various programming languages.

## Inheritance

### Definition

Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class. It allows for code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

### Examples

In this section, we provide Jupyter Notebook examples that demonstrate how to implement inheritance in various programming languages.

## Setup

To run the examples provided in this repository, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
